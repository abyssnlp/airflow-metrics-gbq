Airflow Metrics to BigQuery
===

Sends airflow metrics to Bigquery

**TODO**
- List steps to send (activate statsd in airflow.cfg etc)
- Add `ci`
- Add github workflow
- CODEOWNERS, Pull request template, Workflow for PR, custom actions
- Package release based on Tag
- Better docs and sphinx docs from docstrings
- To pypi

**Enhance**
- Add a buffer (pyzmq or mp queue)
- Run sending metrics to GBQ in another process
